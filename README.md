# Flip-The-Tiles
It is developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

It is also called as the "MEMORY GAME" or "THE MEMORY MATCHING GAME". It is called so because the main skill in the game is your memory- How well you can remember the position of tiles.

The game consists of an even number of tiles with images on one side and a generic back. Each image appears on two tiles and we are supoosed to match them. When the game starts, all tiles are turned down.

The player then flips two cards, selecting by clicking on them. If two tiles have the same image, the score increases by one. Otherwise, the tiles flip back over after a small period of time.

The ultimate goal of the game is to get all the tiles flipped face up i.e. to find all the matching pairs. This has to be done in the least number of moves and in lesser time as well.
